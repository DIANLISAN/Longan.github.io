Education
======
* B.S. in Artificial Intelligence, College of Computer Science, Sichuan University, 2025(expected)

Work experience
======
* June 2022 -- Present: Research Assistant in Machine Intelligence Laboratory
  * Sichuan University
  * Supervisor: Prof. Peng Hu
  * Work:
    - Introduced a novel approach for Cross-modal Hashing on noisy labels under pytorch framework, worked with Prof. Peng Hu, Prof. Dezhong Peng, Prof. Xi Peng, Mr. Qin Yang and Mr. Yuan Sun, which can concentrate on reliable pairings and dynamically identify noisy samples with a 6.2\% improvement on MAP scores compared to state-of-the-art methods.
    - Developed a cerebral palsy rehabilitation training system integrating STGCN for skeletal motion tracking and analysis, along with a CNN+Transformer-based dual neural network for real-time emotion detection, aimed at enhancing collaborative training with patients' families and physicians, guided by Prof. Peng Hu and Prof. Hongchen He.
    - Submitted a paper to the MMâ€™24 conference (**CCF-A**) as the **first author**.
    - Granted **1** utility model patent and **5** software copyrights; submitted **2** invention patents.
  

* May 2023 -- August 2023: NUS SOC Summer Workshop 2023
  * National University of Singapore
  * Supervisor: Prof. Danny Poo
  * Work:
    - Studied on techniques including statistical modeling, machine learning algorithms, and interactive dashboard creation for Big Data Analysis and Visualization, guided by Prof. Danny Poo and Ms. Guoting Kong.
    - Proposed a predictive model for the Beijing property market, employing financial techniques such as K-charts and MA-charts for house price trend analysis, using DNNs to establish a feature-to-price mapping for price rationality assessments, and generating heatmaps to guide investors towards profitable locations.
    - Secured **First Prize** and achieved an **A+** rating for the project.
